ZeroBPMFInput v0.1
Copyright (c) 2008 Zero, Chien-An Cho

這是一個給 Android 使用的注音輸入法，目前在G1上實際測試過可以使用。
This is a BPMF(Phonetic) input method for Android. It has been tested on T-mobile G1.

== Usage ==

  您應該在安裝後啟動這隻程式。第一次啟動時，程式會自動由網路上下載注音資料庫。
  接著此程式會註冊在系統通知中，當您需要輸入文字的時候請拉下通知清單。
  並且點選輸入法，然後使用鍵盤輸入後選取複製，程式將會自動將文字複製到剪貼簿中，
  並且幫您返回。您只需要再貼上到文字框中就可以了。這是目前 Android 不支援IME的暫時性
  解決方案。當您不想要使用輸入法了，可以點結束輸入法。輸入法退出時會清除於通知區的
  訊息。

  You should start this program after installed. For the first launch, this program will
  download phonetic database from Internet. After initiated, this program will register
  itself in the notification area. When you need to input, please drag down the notification
  list and click on the IME. Use the keyboard to input, and click copy. The program will copy
  it to clipbarod and return to the original program. Just paste it in the textbox and done.
  This is a temporary workaround for Android which does not support IME currently. When you
  don't want to use it anymore, you can click Exit IME. The program will clear the message in
  notification area when exiting.

== Known Issues ==

  1. 您目前不能輸入實體鍵盤上沒有的符號，使用Alt鍵才能使用的也不行。
     You can't type some symbol which is not have a key on the physical keyboard, even it can inputed by using Alt key.
